# SweetDebt

EF/Razor Pages/Docker/Azure App Service

[Azure](https://sweetdebt-bkekdqdwb5f8hca8.germanywestcentral-01.azurewebsites.net/)

This project is my first aproach to ASP.NET for WebApp at all, main goal is handle logic on backend, EntityFramework, understand DI, handle Authentication and Authorization with cookies, Routing, Attributes of ASP.NET and so on.

SweetDebt serving me to remember, how much money I borrow from my gf.

## Issues:
### Design:
	1.	Set padding/size for buttons
	2.	Garbage problem with Bootstrap/CSS
	
### Funcionality:	
	1.	Add more funcions (Delete,NewUser,EmailAddress,Sending emails after events,..)

### Figure out:
	1.	Dockerfile with volume, EF migration and update-database after deploy, add create of admin accout(for now)
	2.	Azure deploy
